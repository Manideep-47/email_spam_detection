# email_spam_detection

An email spam detection project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). Here's a brief overview:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of labeled emails (spam and non-spam).

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the data by removing noise, such as special characters, HTML tags, and stop words. Convert the text into a format suitable for machine learning, like tokenization and normalization.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Use techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings to transform text data into numerical features.

4. **Model Training**: Choose and train a machine learning model such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or deep learning models like LSTM or CNN on the extracted features.

5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.

6. **Optimization**: Continuously refine the model by updating the training data and feature extraction methods.

This project tell us about text processing and classification to effectively filter out spam emails.
